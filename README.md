# hsp-deck-crawler

# Overview
This is an automated scraper for collecting deck data from [the Hearthstone Decks section of Hearthpwn](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks?filter-show-constructed-only=y&filter-deck-tag=1).<br>
The scraper retrieves the text content from the popup that appears upon clicking "Export to Cockatrice" on each deck page, then saves it as a TXT file.

# Usage
Simply run `main.py` to start the scraping process.<br>
You can adjust the scraping range by modifying the `page_count` variables in the script.
